        description: 'This fully restored Steinway & Sons Model D Concert Grand Piano was built in 1932 at the New York Steinway Factory. This exquisite concert level instrument has undergone an exacting rebuilding process. Built during the ‘golden age’ of Steinway & Sons quality, this instrument is a beautiful example of Steinway’s legendary quality. This nine-foot piano shows the reason that over 90% of concert pianists continue to choose Steinway. This piano features an incredible sound and a fully regulated, very responsive action. Pictured with an optional Jansen Artist Bench.',
